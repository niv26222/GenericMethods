# GenericMethods





In the above example, we have declared a Swap generic method. In that method we have declared a Type argument after the method name <T>. T is the type argument. In the main method, we pass Swap method with <int> type argument. That means, we can only pass parameters of int types. We declared two int parameters and pass into the Swap method.
